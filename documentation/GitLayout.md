Using GitHub as a content hub.

## Template Collection
This is where collection of template are stored. It can be freely cloned to working repositories.

# How does it work?

User creates GitHub account
User registers at GitLayout license server, www.gitlayout.com
Clone one or more template from Template Collection to users account.
allow job@gitlayout.com as shared user for the repo. This allows us to work.
It works by trigering layout process by webhook when commit.
