# Image Handling

Images are place in couple of ways

## Putting images infomation
1. put image file info in heading meta-data with style options

## Putting images in folder

1. put image in /images folder, 
this is default where image just flows along with paragraph

1. put images in /images/category_name.
this is how we apply different image styles, such as size, location, full page, bleeding by image groups etc..
Image file name can be used for captions, in catalogs or school year book, where there are many images and the correct caption information is critical.

## Using image caption file. 
We can have image caption file that contains more information, maybe title and body.
Image caption files have file name as image_name.md and stored in same folder along with image_name.jpg or image_name.pdf.
It can also contain meta-data with style specifications
 - type
	full_page_image
	first_page_image(dovira image)
	running_image
	running_image_small
	
 - image_styles	
 	- full_page
 	- full_page_bleed
 	- bottom_half
 	- bottom_bleed
 	- top_half
 	- top_bleed
	- full_column
 	- half_column

## mixing options 
I need more feedback from users.
I can used above options for now, and we will see what is the preferred way by users.

example
1. should put first page images in meta-data
