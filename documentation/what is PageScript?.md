In 1984 Macintosh computer was introduced. Apple also introduced DTP, a new publishing term for Desk Top Publishing. And the rest is a history. We all know the story of publishing revolution that it caused.

It has been more than 30 years, since the revolution. And publishing industry has been through many changes, internet, mobile and social media. And yet we are using pretty much the same editing tools. We went through PageMaker, QuarkXpress, and now InDesign.

Print Publishing industry is not growing, in fact, it seems to be shrinking.
It is not just the cost of Page Layout Program, that is costing publisher, rather it is the cost of cost Designers.

Can this process be improved?

There has been many efforts to automate the page layout process, but it has been successful in only a few areas, such as business card, and banner, where designs are relatively simple.
But it remains unsuccessful in many publishing areas.

Why have they failed to automated the design layout process? 
It is because there can be so many different page layout design combinations to be covered by templates. There are just to many possible combinations to be handled by just few static templates.

There is a new solution for print publishing industry. The new concept is why not make design template as responsive template, like they do it in web design space like Twitter Boostrap. Have a JavaScript calculate the right size and position for each different situations.

PageScript is similar to it, a programing language for creating PDF. A high level Page Descript Lanugage written in Ruby DSL.  PageScript can be used to create design template. And they can be processed in the server. The result is page layout automation.
