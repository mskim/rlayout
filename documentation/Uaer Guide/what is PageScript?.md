In 1984 Macintosh computer was introduced. Apple also introduced DTP, a new publishing term for Desk Top Publishing. And the rest is a history. We all know the story of publishing revolution that it caused.

It has been more than 30 years, since the revolution. And publishing industry has been through many changes, internet, mobile and social media. And yet we are using pretty much the same editing tools. We went through PageMaker, QuarkXpress, and now InDesign.

Print Publishing industry is not growing, in fact, it seems to be shrinking.
It is not just the cost of Page Layout Program, that is costing publisher, rather it is the cost of Designers or should I say InDesign operators. Since they don't do much of Design work, rather most of their work consists of operating the InDesign application. 

Can this process be improved?

There has been many efforts to automate the page layout process, but it has been successful in only a few areas, such as business card, and banner, where designs are relatively simple.
But it remains unsuccessful in many publishing areas.

Why have we failed to automated the design layout process? 
It is because we would need so many templates. If we had 5 different areas on a magazine page, heading, image, body text, header, side_box. And we have 5~6 different options, the permutations would be 5x5x5x5x5. And it could easily exceed 3,000. It is why it was not practical to use templates. If surely sounds like a job for computer. We need a programming language, a language for page layout, higher level than PostScript.

PageScript is a programming language for creating PDF. A high level Page Description language written in Ruby DSL.  PageScript can be used to create design template. And they can be processed in the server. The result is page layout automation.
