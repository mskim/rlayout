# Design Script

Wouldn't it be great if we had something like Ruby On Rails for Publishing?

design new my_magazine --template=times_clone

it creates bunch of folders and templates for writing markdown files, images to fill-in

```ruby

rake pdf 

```

then voala! 

You have pdf version of the magazine



And to tell your boss that you've been woking for whole weekend to meet the deadline.

```ruby

rake idml

```

You have InDesign files for the entire magazine.


then for the web version

```ruby

rake web

```

You have static web site for the magazine
