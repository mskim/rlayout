# Overleaf

I saw the site a few years ago, but now they have grown to be a force to be recon with in tech publishing world.
They provide online technical publishing tool. 
They are using all the open source LaText tools and Web Tools to integrate this solution. This is brilliant!!!

## Framework Stack
	- Ruby on Rails
	- LaTex tools, like pdflatex
	- code-mirror for web editing
	- Github, Dropbox, integration
	- Amazon AWS backend storage

We are doing pretty much the same thing, except we are using PageScript in place of LaTex language, and rlayout in place of pdflatex for pdf rending.
	
One of the nice feature that I should look into is "Edit in Overleaf".
They provide API to place "Edit in Overleaf" button in partner sites.
"Edit in Overleaf" button provides ability to hand over the content editing to the Overleaf site from partner site.

This means that our partners, designers and printers, can setup their static site on "AWS" or "github page" in minutes. This can go viral!!!
