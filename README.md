## Next Generation Publishing tool.

The goal of this project is to create a next generation publishing tools.
We have been enjoying the publishing tools from DTP(DeskTop publishing) from 80's.
But the revolustionary ideas that benefitted so much, are now showing it's age. 
And it is about time we improve out publishing tooks.

## What is wrong with current tools?

DTP apps were designed for designers in mind, 
and not for average people would to be using them.
So, the whole publiahsing process has become dependent on designers or DTP program operators,
Designer are often doing mundane tasks, not creative designing.
and it is becoming the bottlnect of whole publishing process, costing time and money.

## We should have tools that are more effient.

We need a tools that can automate mundane tasks with resueable designs. 
There has been many attemps to automate the designing process, 
mostly using "design template" approch. But they have not been very sucessful, 
only in handful of arers were applicable namely business card, banners, and some photo book.
It is proven that it is not so easy using current desing tools.
We need to approch in a whole new way.

## DTP programs have only a handful of tool boxes.

TextBox, Lines, Rectangle, Circle, ImageBox and few other basic tool boxes were provided by the application.

## It is difficault to automate the process.
